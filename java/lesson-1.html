    <h2>Installing a compiler</h2>
    <p>Before we can even start writing in C++, we'll need to install a compiler. We'll be using g++.</p>
    <br />
    <p>On mac, it's as simple as running</p>
    <pre>brew install gcc</pre>
    <p>in your terminal to install g++. </p>
    <br />
    <p>For windows, it's a bit more complicated. There is no standalone g++ you can install, instead you need to install a dev environment such as msys2 or tdm-gcc. In this tutorial, we'll be using msys2.</p>
    <p>Go to the <a href="https://www.msys2.org/">msys2 website</a>, and follow their instructions on installation.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Once you've installed g++, run</p>
    <pre>g++ --version</pre>
    <p>to confirm that it's correctly set up.</p>
    <p>If it recognizes the command, all's well and good.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Installing a text editor</h2>
    <p>The next step is installing a text editor, so that we have a way to actually write code. I recommend using vscode, but you can follow this guide with any other app if you want.</p>
    <p>Click on the download button in the center of the <a href="http://code.visualstudio.com/">vscode website</a>, and then download it like any other app.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Once you're in the app, you can optionally install plugins that will help you code in c++.</p>
    <p>Click on the little icon with 4 blocks on top of each other, and search for the C/C++ extension made by Microsoft.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Once you have your compiler and your text editor, you're ready to start coding!</p>
