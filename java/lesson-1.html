    <h2>Installing java</h2>
    <p>First things first, we need to install a Java Development Kit (JDK), so that we can actually code in java. Many different companies have made their own JDKs, but we'll be using Oracle's version.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Start by going to <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">Oracle's JDK download page</a> and download the correct version for your OS. Download whatever version of java is featured at the top of the website, although the version doesn't matter too much.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Once the installer has been downloaded, run it and install the JDK like any other app.</p>
    <p>To verify that java is installed correctly, run</p>
    <pre>java --version</pre>
    <p>In your terminal. It should output the version of java that you installed.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Installing a text editor</h2>
    <p>The next step is installing a text editor, so that we have a way to actually write code. I recommend using vscode, but you can follow this guide with any other app if you want.</p>
    <p>Click on the download button in the center of the <a href="http://code.visualstudio.com/">vscode website</a>, and then download it like any other app.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Once you're in the app, you can optionally install plugins that will help you code in java.</p>
    <p>Click on the little icon with 4 blocks on top of each other, and search for the Java extension made by Oracle Corporation.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Once you have JDK and your text editor, you're ready to start coding!</p>
