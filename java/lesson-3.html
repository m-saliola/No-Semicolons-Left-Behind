    <h2>Your first "Hello, World!"</h2>
    <p>In the java file you created last time, add</p>
    <pre>System.out.println("Hello, World!")</pre>
    <p>in the space between the two center curly braces. Your program should look like</p>
    <pre>public class Main {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!")
  }
}</pre>
    <p>Compile and run this program, and you should see</p>
    <pre>Hello, World!</pre>
    <p>right under where you ran it.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Why is there an error?</h2>
    <p>In java, every line needs to be ended with a semicolon, to separate one line of code to the other so the compiler knows how to compile our program.</p>
    <p>So in our code, we need to add a semicolon after our println statement. Your code should look like</p>
    <pre>public class Main {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }
}</pre>
    <br />
    <p>If you're wondering why there aren't any semicolons after the 4 other lines, that's because they all end with a curly brace.</p>
    <p>For now, just remember that in java, every line has to end with either a semicolon or a curly brace.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Re-compile and run it and now you should actually see some text get printed.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Running your program</h2>
    <p>Running your program is very simple, the only thing to do is run</p>
    <pre>java Main</pre>
    <p>in the vscode terminal.</p>
    <br />
    <p>If you called your file something else, for example PotatoMachine, you'd instead run</p>
    <pre>java PotatoMachine</pre>
    <br />
    <p>If you're wondering why nothing happens when you run it, it's because we haven't programmed it to do anything yet. We'll do that in the next lesson.</p>
    <br />
    <p>If, for some reason, something did happen, like an error message, make sure that you run java Main (or your own file name) with no typos, and no .java or .class at the end.</p> 
    <br />
    <p>In the next lesson, we'll make your program output something when it's run.</p>
