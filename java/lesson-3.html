    <h2>Your first "Hello, World!"</h2>
    <p>In the java file you created last time, add</p>
    <pre>System.out.println("Hello, World!")</pre>
    <p>in the space between the two center curly braces. Your program should look like</p>
    <pre>public class Main {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!")
  }
}</pre>
    <p>Compile and run this program, and you should see</p>
    <pre>Hello, World!</pre>
    <p>right under where you ran it.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Compiling your first program</h2>
    <p>To compile a java program, we use the javac command that comes with the JDK we installed in the last lesson.</p>
    <p>Open vscode's terminal by pressing ctrl+`, and run</p>
    <pre>javac Main.java</pre>
    <p>This will create a new file called Main.class which is the compiled version of your program.</p>
    <p>If the file was not created, or if the command outputted an error message, then something is wrong with your code.</p>
    <br />
    <p>If you named your file something other than Main, just replace Main.java with the name of your file. For example, if my program was called PotatoMachine.java, I would need to run</p>
    <pre>javac PotatoMachine.java</pre>
    <br />
    <p>Next up: running the program you just compiled!</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Running your program</h2>
    <p>Running your program is very simple, the only thing to do is run</p>
    <pre>java Main</pre>
    <p>in the vscode terminal.</p>
    <br />
    <p>If you called your file something else, for example PotatoMachine, you'd instead run</p>
    <pre>java PotatoMachine</pre>
    <br />
    <p>If you're wondering why nothing happens when you run it, it's because we haven't programmed it to do anything yet. We'll do that in the next lesson.</p>
    <br />
    <p>If, for some reason, something did happen, like an error message, make sure that you run java Main (or your own file name) with no typos, and no .java or .class at the end.</p> 
    <br />
    <p>In the next lesson, we'll make your program output something when it's run.</p>
