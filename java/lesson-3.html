    <h2>Your first "Hello, World!"</h2>
    <p>In the java file you created last time, add</p>
    <pre>System.out.println("Hello, World!")</pre>
    <p>in the space between the two center curly braces. Your program should look like</p>
    <pre>public class Main {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!")
  }
}</pre>
    <p>Compile and run this program, and you should see</p>
    <pre>Hello, World!</pre>
    <p>right under where you ran it.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Why is there an error?</h2>
    <p>In java, every line needs to be ended with a semicolon, to separate one line of code to the other so the compiler knows how to compile our program.</p>
    <p>So in our code, we need to add a semicolon after our println statement. Your code should look like</p>
    <pre>public class Main {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }
}</pre>
    <br />
    <p>If you're wondering why there aren't any semicolons after the 4 other lines, that's because they all end with a curly brace.</p>
    <p>For now, just remember that in java, every line has to end with either a semicolon or a curly brace.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Re-compile and run it and now you should actually see some text get printed.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Changing the text</h2>
    <p>If you want to print something other than</p>
    <pre>Hello, World!</pre>
    <p>then you just need to change the text in between the quotation marks to be whatever you want. For example, this</p>
    <pre>System.out.println("Potato Machine");</pre>
    <p>will print</p>
    <pre>Potato Machine</pre>
    <br />
    <p>Make sure to remember the quotes, your code won't work without them!</p>
