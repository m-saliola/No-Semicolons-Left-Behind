    <h2>Your first "Hello, World!"</h2>
    <p>In the c++ file you created last time, add</p>
    <pre>std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl</pre>
    <p>in the space between the two curly braces. Your program should look like</p>
    <pre>int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl
}</pre>
    <br />
    <p>You also need to include iostream, which gives c++ the ability to print. Think of it as telling the program to learn how to print, before actually attempting to write to the terminal.</p>
    <p>The finished program should be</p>
    <pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl
}</pre>
    <br />
    <p>Compile and run this program, and you should see</p>
    <pre>Hello, World!</pre>
    <p>right under where you ran it.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Why is there an error?</h2>
    <p>In c++, every statement needs to be ended with a semicolon, to separate one line of code to the other so the compiler knows how to compile our program.</p>
    <p>So in our code, we need to add a semicolon after our std::cout statement. Your code should look like</p>
    <pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
}</pre>
    <br />
    <p>If you're wondering why there aren't any semicolons after the other lines, that's because they either end with curly braces or include a header, such as iostream, and lines like those don't need semicolons.</p>
    <p>For now, just remember that in c++, every line has to end with either a semicolon or a curly brace, unless they include something.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Re-compile and run it and now you should actually see some text get printed.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Changing the text</h2>
    <p>If you want to print something other than</p>
    <pre>Hello, World!</pre>
    <p>then you just need to change the text in between the quotation marks to be whatever you want. For example, this</p>
    <pre>System.out.println("Potato Machine");</pre>
    <p>will print</p>
    <pre>Potato Machine</pre>
    <br />
    <p>Make sure to remember the quotes, your code won't work without them!</p>
