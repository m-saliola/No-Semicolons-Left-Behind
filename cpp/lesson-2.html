    <h2>There's a little setup!</h2>
    <p>Create a new file in vscode by clicking File/New File. Save it with ctrl+s (command+s if you're on mac) and name it main.cpp. You don't have to name it main, that part can be whatever you want, but the .cpp at the end is essential!</p>
    <br />
    <p>Every program written in c++ has this same block of code that is necessary for the program to work.</p>
    <pre>int main() {
  return 0;
}</pre>
    <p>Don't worry, you don't need to understand what this does just yet. Just know that every program needs these few lines of code.</p>
    <p>Paste it into the file you created earlier, then we'll compile it!</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Compiling your first program</h2>
    <p>To compile a c++ program, we use the g++ compiler we installed in the last lesson.</p>
    <p>Open vscode's terminal by pressing ctrl+`, and run</p>
    <pre>g++ main.cpp -o main</pre>
    <p>This will create a new file called main (main.exe if you're on windows) which is the compiled version of your program.</p>
    <p>If the file was not created, or if the command outputted an error message, then something is wrong with your code.</p>
    <br />
    <p>If you named your file something other than main, just replace 'main' with the name of your file. For example, if I called my program potato_machine.cpp, I would need to run</p>
    <pre>g++ potato_machine.cpp -o potato_machine</pre>
    <br />
    <p>Next up: running the program you just compiled!</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Running your program</h2>
    <p>Running your program is very simple, the only thing to do is run</p>
    <pre>./main</pre>
    <p>in the vscode terminal.</p>
    <br />
    <p>If you called your file something else, for example potato_machine, you'd instead run</p>
    <pre>./potato_machine</pre>
    <br />
    <p>If you're wondering why nothing happens when you run it, it's because we haven't programmed it to do anything yet. We'll do that in the next lesson.</p>
    <br />
    <p>If, for some reason, something did happen, like an error message, make sure that you run ./main (or your own file name) with no typos.</p> 
    <br />
    <p>If you're on windows and it doesn't work, even if you typed it right, try running</p> 
    <pre>./main.exe</pre> 
    <p>instead of just</p>
    <pre>./main</pre>
    <br />
    <p>In the next lesson, we'll make your program output something when it's run.</p>
