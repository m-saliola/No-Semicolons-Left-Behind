    <h2>There's a little setup!</h2>
    <p>Create a new file in vscode by clicking File/New File. Save it with ctrl+s (command+s if you're on mac) and name it main.cpp.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Every program written in c++ has this same block of code that is necessary for the program to work.</p>
    <pre>int main() {
  return 0;
}</pre>
    <p>Don't worry, you don't need to understand what this does just yet. Just know that every program needs these few lines of code.</p>
    <p>Paste it into the file you created earlier, then we'll compile it!</p>
