    <p>Before we can even start writing in C++, we'll need to install a compiler. We'll be using g++.</p>
    <br />
    <p>On mac, it's as simple as running</p>
    <pre>brew install gcc</pre>
    <p>in your terminal to install g++. </p>
    <br />
    <p>For windows, it's a bit more complicated. There is no standalone g++ you can install, instead you need to install a dev environment such as msys2 or tdm-gcc. In this tutorial, we'll be using msys2.</p>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://www.msys2.org/">the msys2 website</a>, and follow their instructions on installation.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Once you've installed g++, run</p>
    <pre>g++ --version</pre>
    <p>to confirm that it's correctly set up.</p>
    <p>If it recognizes the command, all's well and good.</p>
